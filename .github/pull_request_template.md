Please write a description which:

- explains the problem the change tries to solve, i.e. what is wrong with the
  current code without the change

- justifies the way the change solves the problem, i.e. why the result with the
  change is better

- alternate solutions considered but discarded, if any

- link to any relevant issues

If unsure, feel free to submit first and I'll help you along.
